# Predictive Analytics for Student Academic Performance

## Project Overview
This project is dedicated to developing a predictive model that forecasts student success in higher education institutions based on pre-enrollment data, using machine learning techniques.

## Objective
To analyze and predict student academic performance by the end of the first and second semesters, utilizing demographic, socioeconomic, and educational data available at enrollment. I will first use machine learing to predict where a student is enrolled, dropout, or graduated. Then I will analyzed what features had the greatest predictive power and create a presentation with matplotlib and google slides.

## Dataset Synopsis
The dataset includes records from multiple undergraduate degrees and features demographic details, academic paths, and socioeconomic backgrounds, obtained from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

## Methodology and Technologies
- **Python & Scikit-learn**: For model initialization, training, and evaluation.
- **Python Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Python Matplotlib**: For visualizing data insights.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting the data exploration and modeling process.

## Data Source
The dataset is sourced from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Dataset Repository.
